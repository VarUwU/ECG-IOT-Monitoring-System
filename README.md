# ECG-IOT-Monitoring-System Setup Script

This script will guide you through the setup process for the ECG-IOT-Monitoring-System. Please make sure you have the following components before proceeding:
- ECG sensor
- Microcontroller (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi)
- Wi-Fi or Ethernet module for internet connectivity

## Step 1: Hardware Setup

1. Connect the ECG sensor to the microcontroller according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Connect the Wi-Fi or Ethernet module to the microcontroller.

## Step 2: Software Setup

1. Clone or download the code from the ECG-IOT-Monitoring-System repository to your computer.
2. Modify the code to match your specific hardware configuration and internet connectivity.
3. Upload the code to the microcontroller using the appropriate software (such as the Arduino IDE).

## Step 3: Cloud Server Setup

1. Create an account on a cloud server platform (such as AWS or Azure).
2. Create a new instance or virtual machine on the cloud server platform.
3. Install and configure the necessary software (such as Node.js and MongoDB) on the instance or virtual machine.
4. Deploy the ECG-IOT-Monitoring-System code to the instance or virtual machine.

## Step 4: Web Application Setup

1. Create a new account on the ECG-IOT-Monitoring-System web application.
2. Add a new device and configure it with the appropriate settings.
3. View the processed ECG data in real-time or download it for offline analysis.

### Code Files

- `p1.c`: code for processing ECG sensor data
- `p2.c`: code for sending ECG data to cloud server
- `main.c`: main code file for integrating `p1.c` and `p2.c`

That's it! You've successfully set up the ECG-IOT-Monitoring-System. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please refer to the documentation or seek help from the community.
